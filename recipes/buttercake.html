        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>Buttercake - the version that I grew up with - is a dense, moist, cookie-like tart with no filling. 
            It's flavored with almond extract, and my family received the recipe from a very dear friend. 
            Great-Aunt Ruth was German, and so I know this as a German recipe, even though the versions I was able to find online that looked familiar are apparently Dutch.
            Here's how it's made.</p>
